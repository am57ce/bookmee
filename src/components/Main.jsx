          A 'Meet and Greet' service can be arranged when booking whereby the
          driver will be in arrivals with the passengers name or company name,
          whichever you prefer. A comforting thought, especially for first time
          visitors in a foreign country. If your flight is early or subject to
          delays, we will track your flight's progress and send your driver at
          the new expected time of arrival. A lot of our work is corporate based
          so if you are booking a taxi for other people you need not worry we
          will give them the professional quality service they would expect We
          accept most major credit cards and debit cards and send receipts via
          email. OTS also welcomes corporate account customers and, subject to
          credit references, we'll be happy to offer you a monthly invoicing
          facility or direct debit on our airport taxi services.
